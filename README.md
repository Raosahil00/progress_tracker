# 🌳 Interactive Progress Tracking Tree with Shared Nodes

This project is a full-featured **progress tracking application** built entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — designed to visually represent tasks and subtasks in a **tree-like structure**, while supporting **shared child nodes** across multiple parent nodes.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add tasks with name, description, and status
- ✅ Create child nodes under any parent
- ✅ Add a **shared child node** to multiple parents using checkboxes
- ✅ Interactive, collapsible tree structure with real-time DOM rendering
- ✅ Nodes connected visually with lines (using dynamic SVG logic)
- ✅ Fully responsive and accessible layout
- ✅ Context menu on each node with options to Add Child, Edit, or Delete
- ✅ Modal dialog for selecting multiple parents when adding a shared node

## 🧠 Concept

This application functions like a visual **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, with nodes representing tasks/goals and edges representing their relationships. It improves upon traditional trees by allowing:
- Multiple parents for a single child node
- Clear central alignment of shared nodes
- Expand/collapse tree navigation
